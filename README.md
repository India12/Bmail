# About

Final Smartninja project. Email-client - not jet finished. Basic to-do list:
- login with custom login;
- search bar - Javascript?;
- WeatherHandler - when button - Get weather is submitted, empty layout.html is displayed - (weather is correct though);
- create separate email users-actions or something - so that eg: when email is deleted, it is deleted only within specific user - the one that deleted email and etc.
